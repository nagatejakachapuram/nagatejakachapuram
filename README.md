## 🛠️ Security Methodology

My review process follows a structured methodology to ensure comprehensive coverage:  

1. **Recon & Context Building**  
   - Protocol architecture mapping  
   - Threat model creation  

2. **Static Analysis**  
   - Automated scans with **Slither**, **Mythril**, **Solhint**  

3. **Manual Review**  
   - Line-by-line inspection for logic flaws, access control gaps, and unchecked assumptions  

4. **Fuzzing & Property Testing**  
   - Adversarial inputs using **Foundry Fuzz** and **Echidna**  

5. **Exploit Simulation**  
   - Forked mainnet testing for MEV, flash loan attacks, and liquidity stress  

6. **Reporting & Recommendations**  
   - Clear vulnerability classification (Informational → Critical)  
   - Secure patch proposals with code diffs

## 💼 Current Development Focus

* 🧠 **AI-Powered Yield Optimizer**
    * Built with **ElizaOS** + **Chainlink Automation**.
    * Yearn-style vaults with strategy rotation dictated by an off-chain AI agent.
    * Integrates with major DeFi protocols like Aave, Morpho, and Curve.

* ⚙️ **Flare-AMM DEX + Prediction Markets**
    * A modular DEX supporting both token swaps and prediction games.
    * Built from scratch to explore core AMM logic, pricing curves, and oracle-based resolution.

* 🌌 **Noir + ZK Learning**
    * Exploring private applications, proof systems, and tooling with **Noir**.
    * Goal: Launch a fully-private zk-dApp using **Noir + Nargo**.

---

## 📈 Roadmap & Goals

* ✅ Launch AI-powered Yield Optimizer MVP.
* ✅ Launch Flare-AMM DEX with Prediction Market.
* **🏆 Secure a Top-10 placement in a competitive audit contest.**
* **🐞 Find and report a high-impact bug via a bounty program.**
* 🌑 Build and launch a privacy-preserving **zkApp using Noir**.
* 🦀 Master **Rust security patterns** for smart contracts (Solana & CosmWasm).
* **🤝 Contribute security insights to a major DeFi protocol.**
