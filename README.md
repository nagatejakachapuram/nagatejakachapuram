## 🛠️ Security Methodology

1. **Recon & Context Building** – Architecture mapping, threat modeling
2. **Static Analysis** – Automated scans (Slither, Mythril, Solhint)
3. **Manual Review** – Line-by-line inspection for logic flaws & access control
4. **Fuzzing & Property Testing** – Foundry fuzzing, Echidna invariants
5. **Exploit Simulation** – Mainnet forking, MEV & flashloan attack scenarios
6. **Reporting & Recommendations** – Clear severity classification + patch proposals
