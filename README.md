## 💼 Current Focus

* 🧠 **AI-Powered Yield Optimizer**

  * Built with **ElizaOS** + **Chainlink Automation**
  * Yearn-style vaults, strategy rotation via AI agent
  * Low- and high-risk DeFi integrations (Aave, Morpho, Curve, etc.)

* ⚙️ **Flare-AMM DEX + Prediction Markets**

  * A modular DEX supporting both token swaps and prediction games
  * Built from scratch to explore AMM logic, pricing curves, and prediction resolution

* 🔐 **Security Researcher**

  * Performing audits, threat modeling, and formal verification
  * Focused on **Foundry-based testing**, fuzzing, and vulnerability discovery

* 👨‍💻 **Blockchain Intern @ TechStek**

  * Working on smart contract development and security testing
  * Contributing to production-grade DeFi infrastructure

* 🌌 **Noir + ZK Learning**

  * Exploring **zkApps**, proof systems, and tooling with **Noir**
  * Goal: Launch a fully-private zk dApp using **Noir + Nargo**

## 📁 Projects

### 1. **Yield Optimizer AI dApp**

> Smart vaults that route capital based on off-chain AI agents.
> **Repo:** [`yield-optimizer-prod`](https://github.com/nagatejakachapuram/yield-optimizer-prod)

* 🧠 ElizaOS plugin computes best pool for risk profile
* 🛠️ Chainlink Automation triggers vault allocation
* ⚡ Powered by real protocols: Aave, Morpho, Curve (mock/testnet)

### 2. **Flare-AMM DEX & Prediction App**

> Combines AMM-style token swaps with onchain prediction games.

* 🧬 Uses custom pricing curves and market resolution logic
* 🎲 Supports binary outcomes, oracle-triggered event closure
* 💥 Experimental UX for DeFi gaming and trading dynamics
